1. the scope of variables in Python

In Python, the scope of variables declared inside a loop is not confined to the loop itself, unlike some other programming languages that have block scope (like C or Java). Instead, Python variables have function scope. This means that once a variable is defined anywhere within a function, it is accessible throughout the entire function, including any loops or if statements inside that function.
