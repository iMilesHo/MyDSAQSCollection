# name: 55 - Sales Above Average

Instructions
You need to write a function in Swift that calculates the maximum number of consecutive days when the sales for your sales team were above average.
The function should take an array of integers called sales, which represents the number of sales for the last n days. The length of the sales array should be between 5 and 50, and the value of each element in the array should be between 0 and 50.
The function should return an integer representing the maximum number of consecutive days where the sales were more than the average value of the given sales. If the input contains negative sales, or if the sample size is less than five or more than 50, the function should return -1.
Examples:
If 5 = [100, 100, 200, 400, 500, 100, 200, 400], the expected output =
2 (since there are 2 consecutive days where the sales were above the average amount of 250.)
If 5 = [400, 100, 200, 500, 100, 100, 100, 400], the expected output =
1 (since there is only 1 consecutive day where the sales were above the average amount of 237.5.)
For this test you're using
Feel free to add comments in your code explaining your solution.

```swift
func salesAboveAverage(_ sales: [Int]) -> Int {
    let n = sales.count
    if n < 5 || n > 50 || sales.contains(where: { $0 < 0 || $0 > 50 }) {
        return -1
    }
    let average = sales.reduce(0, +) / n
    var maxConsecutiveDays = 0
    var currentConsecutiveDays = 0
    for sale in sales {
        if sale > average {
            currentConsecutiveDays += 1
            maxConsecutiveDays = max(maxConsecutiveDays, currentConsecutiveDays)
        } else {
            currentConsecutiveDays = 0
        }
    }
    return maxConsecutiveDays
}
```
