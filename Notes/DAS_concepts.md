- What is Trie?

Trie is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings. Tries are used to search for strings in a dataset. The key advantage of using a trie is that it allows for fast lookups in a dataset of strings. Tries are also used in search engines, spell checkers, and other applications that require fast string lookups.
